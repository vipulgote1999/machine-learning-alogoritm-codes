# machine learning using sklearn and tensorflow
A lot of persons are vary curious about machine learning implementation. but they donâ€™t know how to implement them. So from today onwards, I will be posting some of the machine learning model building techniques and also I'm covering some of deep learning model building techniques .here a guide of making machine learning models with the help of scikit-learn and TensorFlow 2.0 and some of the important library like pandas,numpy and important one is matplotlib

Machine learning is the practice of teaching a computer to learn. The concept uses pattern recognition, as well as other forms of predictive algorithms, to make judgments on incoming data. This field is closely related to artificial intelligence and computational statistics.

so first u have to create an environment on which u can run all python code or u have to install python 3.6 version which we are going to prefer for all our projects. Here is a link for installing python 3.6 

1. for windows:-
  :https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/
   choose any one Windows x86 or x64 executable installer 
2. For Ubuntu or Linux:-
http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2017/07/install-python-3-6-1-in-ubuntu-16-04-lts/
Just follow the steps 
3. For mac users:-
https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/
Just follow the steps
